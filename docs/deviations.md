# Deviations Log

Every departure from [`docs/preregistration.md`](preregistration.md) and the published plan,
dated, with a reason. Append only.

Deviations recorded *before* the `prereg-v1` tag are design refinements. Anything after the
tag is a real deviation and must be reported in the write-up.

## Pre-tag (design refinements)

### 2026-08-18 — `src/emocap/vocab/` instead of `src/emocap/tokenize/`
The published plan named the subpackage `tokenize/`. Renamed to `vocab/` to avoid a name
that collides with Python's standard-library `tokenize` module — harmless for absolute
imports, but a confusing thing to leave in a research codebase.

### 2026-08-18 — Python 3.12.14 rather than 3.11
`pyproject.toml` requires `>=3.11`; `uv` resolved 3.12.14. No reason to pin lower. Locked
versions: `torch 2.13.0`, `transformers 5.15.0`.

### 2026-08-18 — `DecodeConfig.length_penalty` semantics stated explicitly
Normalisation is `sum_logprob / len ** length_penalty` over the **generated** length,
matching HuggingFace's `BeamSearchScorer` so Track A and Track B are scored on one scale.
Note that HF normalises by *full sequence* length; for Track B the prefix is not part of the
generated sequence, so the two agree. Verified by
`tests/test_decode_vs_hf.py::test_matches_hf_beam_search`.
